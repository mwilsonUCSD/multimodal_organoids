    % ind_light_all = indices of all the light spikes in relation to t_amplifier [nTotalLightSpikes]
    % ind_dark_all = indices of all the dark spikes in relation to t_amplifier [nTotalDarkSpikes]
    % t_amplifier = aquisition time from amplifier board

    % nFreq = number of frequencies (resolution of x-axis)
    % win = window size [seconds * fs]

    % nickname = nickname of data for figure labeling
